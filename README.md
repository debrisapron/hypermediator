# HYPERMEDIATOR

A pet project to:

- Scratch an itch I have for an online debate site...yeah I know
- Demonstrate that I can build websites with React / Redux / GraphQL
- Write a fully isomorphic & blindingly fast SPA
- Get to know some new tech I haven't had enough time with yet

This is WORK IN PROGRESS and has a whole bunch of issues!

It is also wildly over-engineered for what it is right now :)
